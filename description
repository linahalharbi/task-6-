Description

in this task of sorting boxes in production line , i have used the force sensor resistor sensor to sense the weight of that certain box ( force / pressure ) and by
that the servo arm will chance its position dependingly . 


Materials :- 

Arduino Uno . 
3 Servo mortors . 
Force sensitive resistor (FSR) sensor  . 
Resistance . 

Connection:- 

First the  Servo motor :- 

Yellow wire to D9 pin   
Brown wire to GND pin 
Red wire to 5v pin 

Second The  FSR sensor   :- 
The positive terminal to 5v pin in Arduino Uno . 
The negative terminal to terminal 2 in resistance .


Third the resistance :- 

 Terminal 1 to GND pin in Arduino Uno 
Terminal 2 to negative terminal of FSR .
Terminal 2 to  A0 of Arduino Uno  .


How it works ?  

We know that  the servo motor arm turn from 0-180 degree  . 
And By using  the FSR that changes its resistance depending on how much force / pressure applied . 
In other words whatever pressure I applied ( boxes )  the servo arm will change it position accordingly . 

### I have used a map method  to map the (0-180) to  either 0,1  / neither to  turn the servo arm position .   

## Please note that tinkered don’t have a FSR instead I have used the vibration motor that acts as FSR . 
## in simulation the tinkered can’t support changing forces /pressures ,so I couldn’t play with the pressure / force input ,but I showed that the circuit works by showing the  servo motors slight moves .
